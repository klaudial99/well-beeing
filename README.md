# BellBeeing
WellBeeing is a web application that consists of 4 modules: social, diet, sports and telemedicine.

It was created in a group of 4 people and was the basis for writing my engineering thesis. I was involved in creating the social module (backend and frontend), which allows to spread the community and share relevant content within the whole system.
 
Detailed description of the project is available [here](http://www.klaudia-laskowska.pl/#/WellBeeing).
